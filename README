Underscore.css is a small but powerful CSS utility belt library.

It is not a framework to help you bootstrap a new site, but rather a
collection of often used code snippets, generic enough to be used with
many different types of designs. Underscore.css is perfect for refactoring
legacy CSS, and can replace many hundreds of lines of existing code.

Including Underscore.css on your site will not alter its layout until you
add Underscore.css classes to your markup. To avoid conflicts with
existing CSS, all classes are prefixed with `_`.

Underscore.css is inspired by several of Nicolas Gallagher's CSS ideas and
projects, like [Normalize](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css).
