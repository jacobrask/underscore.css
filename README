Underscore.css is a small but powerful CSS utility belt library.

It is not a framework to help you bootstrap a new site, but rather a
collection of often used code snippets, generic enough to be used with many
different types of designs.

Including Underscore.css on your site will not alter its layout until you add
Underscore.css classes to your markup. To avoid conflicts with existing CSS,
all classes are prefixed with `_`.

Underscore.css is inspired by several of Nicolas Gallagher's philosophies and
projects, like [Normalize](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css).
